I was tempted to keep the "Hello, World" title that comes with the Gatsby Blog Starter -- but then decided "Oomph" would have more, well... oomph.

Now that I have this blog here, I'm going to start tracking my learnings during this time of exploration (unemployment), and see what I get myself into. This also kickstarts my #100DaysOfGatsby. 

For those of you sticking around, enjoy!
